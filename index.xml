      <description>Implementation with Tensorflow TensorFlow is an open-source software library for dataflow programming across a range of tasks. It is a symbolic math library, and is also used for machine learning applications such as neural networks.
Unlike sklearn.neural_network, tensorflow give us more freedom to set up our neural-network.
The following implementation was taken directly from https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/basic_classification
First of all, let&amp;rsquo;s try to import tensorflow and keras (which is now also part of tensorflow)</description>

      <description>Hi, my name is Go Frendi Gunawan. Currently I work as Backend Engineer at kata.ai.
In this blog, you will find some articles related to software engineering, machine learning, and mathematics.
The articles are intended for mere mortal. Some basic programming/high school math are going to help, but are not required.</description>
